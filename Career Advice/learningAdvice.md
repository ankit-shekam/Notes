# Learn better and faster as a Software Engineer 

1. Register your curiosity
   - go to your notes and creae one with the specific intent to wtire down topics on interest to learn
   - write the what and **why** you want to learn the topic
   - revisit this note and get things dene from this list 

2. Start implementing and figure it out as you go 
   - you'll never find contigous block of time for dedicated learning 
   - learn during the slice of time you get throughout your day 

3. Do your laundary
   - get your hands dirty with the implementation of things, get down to coding things out
   - implement research papers/blogs as you go through those

4. Build basic understanding (foundation) first 
   - learng the basic of a topic first and then move on to the advance (interesting) part of it 
   - eg. start with neural networks, then maths, Ml and finally LLMs, rather than starting with LLMs directly

5. Pick multiple topics at a time 
   - Chances are high that one topic at a time will become boring during the course of learning 
   - better pick multiple (2) topics at a time and jump between them as one becomes boring 
   - time bound and evaluate you progress periodically

# Deciding what to learn

- Deciding Factors : 

1. Experience -
   - **Less than 5 YOE**: you got high energy and less responsibilities so the approach to take is **Breadth First** during this time. Build **solid CS fundamental** knowledge so that down the line switching between sub domains becomes easier
   - **More than 5 YOE**: You have become a senior by now and get paid high salary for the depth of knowledge in your specific field of interest. Time to **get into the depth of things**, down to finer details of implementation. Persue absolute must have fields for learning since by now the 

2. Deciding from finalised list of topics - 
   - **New techology** should be **substantially better** (>= 4X performance than existing ones)
   - **Learning** should be **transferable**, eg New programming paradigm/internals of dstributed storage...
   - Topic **aligns with your role and career plan**

# Learning a new programming language

1. Set clear achievable goals an time bound them with regular evaluation
   - build 3-5 projects with increasing levels of difficulty
   - Rest APIs -> CLI app -> Syystem app -> http server

2. Pick beginner friendly resources - youtube/Udemy/books...

3. Read a lot of code - Find good open-source repos/inner-sourcecompany repos to see how conventions, patterns, module-structuring gets impemented

# Learning from Research Papers

1. Finding the the right paper -
- google scholar 
- Hackernews 
- Good posts on substack/linkedin where people mention top xyz research papers to read for some topic 

2.  dont waste time by just thinking and procrastinating about it -> **read the damn paper**

3. iterate over the paper multiple time 
- first iteration : skim through the paper quickly for understanding the bigger picture and theme
- second iteration : understand each line, expand upon the unknown parts of them
- third iteration : make notes about the entire paper as if you have to teach it to someone with lower understanding of the subject than you
