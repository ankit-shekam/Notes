# What not to do as a Software Engineer

1. Thinking working Code is a job done
   - this is the bare minimum your employeer expects
   - your code hould be extensible, Simple, Follow best practices, Well Documented, Follow coding standards of the code base, should be indistinguishable from rest of the code base, Cover all edge cases during unit and integration tests

2. Reinvening the wheel
   - More so than often the problem you try to solve for has been solved by someone else - check if a usable externaltool/library can be used instead of trying to build one from scratch

3. Trying to Over-Engineer
   - Trying to handle for billion user scale from day zero
   - trying to enforce complex patterns instead of keeping things simple 

4. Having Strong Bias
   - Language/framework agnostic
   - your are paid to solve the business problems, no one cares about the technology most of the times
   - most tech is best suited for a niche use case, find it and use it 

5. Thnking design patterns and principles are everything
   - One size does not fit all
   - nothing is written in stone
