# Networking Protocols : 

- [7 layer networking architecture](./7-layered-OSI-model.md)

1. [TCP/IP](./TCP-IP.md) (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol): The fundamental suite for internet communication.
2. [HTTP](./http.md) (HyperText Transfer Protocol): Used for transferring web pages on the internet.
3. [HTTPS](./https.md) (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure): Secure version of HTTP, using SSL/TLS for encryption.
4. [gRPC](./gRPC.md) (Remote procedure call): HTTP2 based RPC framework developed by Google
5. [WebSocket](websockets.md) : 2 way (fully duplex) communication protocol
6. [webRTC](./webRTC.md) (Web Real-Time Communication) : webSocket based framework fro real-time apps
7. [FTP](./ftp.md) (File Transfer Protocol): Used for transferring files between computers on a network.
8. [DNS](./dns.md) (Domain Name System): Translates domain names to IP addresses.
9. [SSH](./ssh.md) (Secure Shell): Provides secure access to remote systems.
10. [SSL/TLS](./ssl-tls.md) (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security): Protocols for securing data transmission.
11. [UDP](./udp.md) (User Datagram Protocol): A simpler, connectionless protocol compared to TCP.
12. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): Used for sending emails.
13. IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol): Used for retrieving emails from a server.
14. POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3): Another protocol for retrieving emails from a server.
15. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol): Maps IP addresses to MAC addresses.
16. RIP (Routing Information Protocol): Used for routing within a small to medium-sized network.
17. BGP (Border Gateway Protocol): Used for routing between different autonomous systems on the internet.
18. SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol): Used for managing devices on IP networks.
